# Customer Segmentation via Unsupervised Learning (KMeans + DBSCAN)

This repository contains an unsupervised learning study on **customer segmentation** using a fully reproducible **scikit-learn Pipeline**.  
The work is organized as a two-stage analysis:

1) **KMeans diagnostics** to estimate a reasonable number of clusters (Elbow + Silhouette).  
2) **DBSCAN clustering** (with scaling + PCA) to identify dense customer groups and potential outliers.

## Research Goal
- Segment customers into groups that are internally coherent and well-separated.
- Justify clustering choices using quantitative criteria and diagnostic plots.

## Methodology (What the notebook does)
### Preprocessing (Pipeline-based)
- Drop missing rows
- Remove duplicates
- One-hot encode categorical features (handle unknown categories)
- Standardize features

### Deliverable 1 — KMeans model selection
- Compute **WCSS (Elbow)** for k = 2…10
- Compute **Silhouette score** for k = 2…10
- Visualize the dataset in 2D using **PCA** (diagnostic visualization)
- Select the **best k** based on silhouette score

### Deliverable 2 — DBSCAN clustering
- Apply preprocessing + scaling
- Reduce dimensionality with **PCA (3 components)**
- Fit **DBSCAN** with chosen parameters (`eps`, `min_samples`)
- Report:
  - silhouette score
  - cluster label distribution (including noise label `-1`, if produced)

## Repository Contents
- `Code.ipynb` — Main end-to-end notebook (preprocessing + KMeans diagnostics + DBSCAN clustering)
- `customer_segments.csv` — Dataset used in the analysis
- `Extra exploratory data analysis ...` — Additional EDA / supporting analysis
- `README.md` — Project overview

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
2. Ensure `customer_segments.csv` is in the same folder as `Code.ipynb`.
3. Run the notebook top-to-bottom.

## Outputs (generated by the notebook)
- PCA scatter plot (2D)
- Elbow curve (WCSS vs k)
- Silhouette curve (score vs k)
- Printed summary:
  - optimal k from Deliverable 1
  - DBSCAN silhouette score from Deliverable 2
  - cluster sizes per label

## Notes / Limitations
- DBSCAN silhouette scores can be sensitive to **noise points** (label `-1`) and the number of clusters found.
- DBSCAN parameters (`eps`, `min_samples`) are currently set manually; a parameter search could be added for stronger justification.
